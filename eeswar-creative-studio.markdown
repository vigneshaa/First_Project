The scope of the project
The brain made up of many regions that communicate millions of messages every second. Traditional neuroimaging analyses have considered each region separately and therefore failed to capture many aspects of brain structure and function. The scona project provides open source, documented, tested and modular code to investigate structural covariance in the brain as a network. These analyses are reproducible, transparent and accessible to new and expert brain imaging researchers and network neuroscientists.

Within the GSoC program I was able to achieve the following deliverables:

Development of the command line tool that allows users to complete an entire neuroimaging analysis from start to finish;
Implementation of visualisation module to plot MRI data and the results of structural covariance brain network analyses;
Improvement of the visualisation results and output reports at the end of the analysis, as a result the final visualisations are ready for publication in a scientific journal;
Well-written documentation and clear tutorials to help users better understand how to use the package and its functionalities;
Bugs-fixing and solving issues in the project.
Links to my contributions
There are a bunch of issues within the project, which were used to discuss new features, to find solutions for challenges and to communicate the results. You can easily search for issues by filtering using label “visualisations” and/or “enhancement”.

Here are the links to my merged Pull Requests that cover all the work:

Implementation of visualisation tools #121
Implementation of anatomical network visualisations #140
Add nilearn plotting functionality to scona #145
Add enhancements to the scona #151
